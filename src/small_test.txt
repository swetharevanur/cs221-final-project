<br>
One parcel of land is located off the 101 just outside Laytonville, sits on 10 acres of land and you'll be permitted (Mendocino County) to cultivate for 5,000 square feet of cannabis is either hoop houses, green houses, outdoor or any three combination. There is a stand alone self sufficient pre-fab home on the land for you to live in if you like as well. You'll have access to well water and there is no shortage. The 10 acre property sits 2,000 feet above sea level with beautiful views and lots exposure to the sun, great fertile soil and an ideal climate for growing. You are free to build out either greenhouse or hoop house space for your cannabis cultivation. <br>
<br>
The other property is north of Fort Bragg and sits on the coast with beautiful ocean views, sits on 20 acres of land and is also fully permitted (Mendocino County). With this parcel, greenhouses are not allowed but hoop houses are allowed for cultivating. Would be a great and ideal location for a nursery to grow clones to sell or for your own growing operation. We have buyers that we can put you in touch with if you decide to go the nursery route. We do have a successful nursery that would consider teaming up if you like and we also have a grower who's worked in a nursery who would be willing to run yours for you if you like (a deal you can work out between the two of you). We do have a trailer that you can use to live on the land but the county does require that there is a spec home on the property prior to cultivation which we have the drawings, plans and permits for and that we have priced at $20-25k. Since you will be paying for this to be built so you can live here as well, you will be reimbursed *(with interest) for this cost since it's an improvement to the property. We do have existing materials that we've already purchased and can work out a deal to obtain these materials that you might need.<br>
<br>
You will be responsible for whatever costs associated with running electricity/generator and water for both properties. <br>
<br>
We are asking for $65k OBO non-refundable deposit to secure both properties (**WILL ACCEPT BITCOIN FOR DEPOSIT, OPEN TO OTHER CRYPTO CURRENCIES). <br>
<br>
We are asking $10,000/monthly for both properties and paid equally to each owner of the parcel. People are charging upwards of $2.50-$3.00 a square foot for their cannabis cultivation rentals and that doesn't include permits. <br>
<br>
Now, you will be permitted to cultivate cannabis on 2 parcels of land on 30+ acres collectively and will be permitted for 15,000 square feet worth of space to cultivate cannabis. If you are going the cultivation route, itâ€™s important that you get your distribution license in place as well. For anyone in the industry who knows how much flower can be produced in 15,000 sq ft of space, knows there's a lot of money to be made. <br>
<br>
We are open to leasing out separately and can negotiate accordingly. <br>
<br>
Priced to move fast! <br>

Don't miss out on a smoking deal (pun intended)!<br>

Thank you for your time.
